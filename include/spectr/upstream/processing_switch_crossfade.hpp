/// UPSTREAM COPY of pulp/signal/processing_switch_crossfade.hpp (proposed in
/// Generous-Corp/pulp; namespace pulp_candidate::signal becomes pulp::signal).
/// Kept here until the SDK Spectr builds against carries it; then this file is
/// deleted and the include switched.
///
/// A gap-free, click-free switch between two realisations of the same effect
/// whose LATENCIES differ — a linear-phase and a minimum-phase filter, a
/// high-quality and a low-latency mode, a CPU and a GPU path.
///
/// Swapping such realisations at a block boundary is audible twice over:
///
///   - the incoming realisation starts with no history, so for its own
///     latency it emits silence (a dropout — 213 ms for an 8192/2048 WOLA
///     engine at 48 kHz) and for the length of its impulse a partial response;
///   - the outgoing realisation stops mid-waveform, leaving a step.
///
/// The switch therefore runs in two phases, counted in samples on the audio
/// thread:
///
///   1. WARM — both realisations process the same input; only the outgoing
///      one is heard. The incoming one fills its delay line and its impulse
///      history, so when it is first heard its output is already steady.
///   2. FADE — a `TransitionMixer` EqualPower fade (smoothstep-shaped, so both
///      ends are corner-free) from the outgoing output to the incoming one.
///      The two carry the same material at different delays, which is
///      uncorrelated over a fade, so equal POWER keeps the level constant.
///
/// What no fade can remove: the content moves in time by the difference of
/// the two latencies, because that is what changing the latency means. The
/// host's delay compensation re-aligns it; the fade makes the move smooth.
///
/// The caller owns both realisations and runs them; this type owns only the
/// sample schedule and the blend. `plan_processing_switch()` and
/// `processing_switch_gains_at()` are pure, so a test or a UI can state what a
/// switch will do without running audio through it.
